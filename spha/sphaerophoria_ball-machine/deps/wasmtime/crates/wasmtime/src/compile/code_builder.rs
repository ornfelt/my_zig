/// Builder-style structure used to create a [`Module`](crate::module::Module) or
/// pre-compile a module to a serialized list of bytes.
///
/// This structure can be used for more advanced configuration when compiling a
/// WebAssembly module. Most configuration can use simpler constructors such as:
///
/// * [`Module::new`](crate::Module::new)
/// * [`Module::from_file`](crate::Module::from_file)
/// * [`Module::from_binary`](crate::Module::from_binary)
///
/// Note that a [`CodeBuilder`] always involves compiling WebAssembly bytes
/// to machine code. To deserialize a list of bytes use
/// [`Module::deserialize`](crate::Module::deserialize) instead.
///
/// A [`CodeBuilder`] requires a source of WebAssembly bytes to be configured
/// before calling [`compile_module_serialized`] or [`compile_module`]. This can be
/// provided with either the [`wasm`] or [`wasm_file`] method. Note that only
/// a single source of bytes can be provided.
///
/// # WebAssembly Text Format
///
/// This builder supports the WebAssembly Text Format (`*.wat` files).
/// WebAssembly text files are automatically converted to a WebAssembly binary
/// and then the binary is compiled. This requires the `wat` feature of the
/// `wasmtime` crate to be enabled, and the feature is enabled by default.
///
/// If the text format is not desired then the [`CodeBuilder::wat`] method
/// can be used to disable this conversion.
