  <h2>How?</h2>
  <p>
    Each chamber is defined as a WASM module. These WASM modules expose an API
    that allows them to perform physics on a set of balls given to them, and
    render whatever they want to an HTML canvas<br />
  </p>
  <p>Chambers are expected to expose the following API</p>

  <h3>Memory model</h3>
  <p>
    WASM modules can have either imported or exported memory. We expect chambers
    to manage their own memory. Chambers should export a memory segment called
    "memory" that we use for chamber IO. Note that the maximum amount of memory
    that a chamber is allowed to use is limited. See
    <a href="#resource_constraints">Resource constraints</a> for more detail.

  <h3>Coordinate systems</h3>
  <p>
    Chambers work in normalized units. The width of the chamber is always 1.0.
    The height of the chamber will be a little smaller. You can assume that the
    chamber height is 0.7 in normalized space. 0.7 is arbitrary, but cannot
    change. Assume that the bottom left corner of your chamber is at (0, 0), and
    the top right is at (1.0, 0.7).
  </p>
  <p>
    When using our physics library, all calculations are made with x of [0.0,
    1.0], y [0.0, 0.7]
  </p>
  <p>
    Ball positions are in these units, when the ball leaves these ranges, it is
    moved into an adjacent chamber
  </p>
  <p>
    Velocity is measured in normalized units / second, where 1 second is equal
    to delta 1.0
  </p>
  <h4>Rendering</h4>
  <p>
    Since rendering is done in pixels, we need to convert from our normalized
    internal representation to pixel space. I recommend that you work in
    normalized units, as there is no guarantee on the pixel dimensions of the
    chamber will stay consistent between frames.
  </p>
  <p>
    Canvas Y dimensions are inverted from our normalized system. Conversion
    should be as follows
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code>
y_px = canvas_height - y_norm * canvas_width
x_px = x_norm * canvas_width
  </code>
  </pre>
  <h3>Physics</h3>
  <p>
    Feel free to do whatever you want... however, you are going to struggle if
    you do not at least have the ball structure definition. We expose a physics
    library called "libphyisics". This provides some useful definitions like
    vec2, pos2, ball, and surface. We also provide some basic collision
    checking. If you need to bounce a ball off a flat surface, we have you
    covered. Other things may require a little bit of linear algebra on your
    end.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are writing zig, you can import
    <a href="/physics.zig">physics.zig</a> into your project and you should be
    ready to go
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are writing C or Rust (or any language where you might want C
    bindings), we provided a pre-compiled
    <a href="/libphysics.a">libphysics.a</a> and a
    <a href="/physics.h">physics.h</a> to work with. If these are not suitable
    for you for whatever reason, feel free to run
    <code>zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall libphysics</code> in the
    ball-machine repo
  </p>
  <p>See <a href="#examples">examples</a> for example usage</p>
  <h3 id="resource_constraints">Chamber development workflow</h3>
  <p>
    If you go to the <a href="/chamber_test.html">chamber testing</a> page, you
    can upload a wasm module and test it completely client side. My suggested
    workflow is to start without worrying about save/load management, make your
    chamber work, then check the save/load checkbox and continue on
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you're happy with the chamber, you can upload it via the
    <a href="/upload.html">upload page</a>. At this point it will be sent to the
    server and queued for validation. The server will automatically ensure that
    the correct APIs are exposed with the correct arguments. It will also check
    if your module uses too much CPU/Memory, so be careful.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case where server validation fails, your chamber should be displayed
    in the <a href="/user.html">user info</a> page with an error message
    propogated from the server. Make adjustments, and try again, or clone
    <a href="https://github.com/sphaerophoria/ball-machine">ball-machine</a> and
    run
    <code
      >zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe && ./zig-out/bin/test_chamber {your
      chamber}</code
    >
  </p>
  <h4>Tips</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Debugging in wasm is hard, if things are crashing, try compiling your
      chamber to an executable and debug with your usual tools
    </li>
    <li>
      Sometimes debugging in wasm is more necessary. We provide a
      <code>env.logWasm(s, len)</code> callback that you can use to print utf8
      encoded text to the javascript console. Just put a pointer and a length in
      there, and we'll print it
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="resource_constraints">Resource constraints</h3>
  <p>
    We limit all of CPU/Memory/Size of chambers. At the moment size is
    implicitly limited by the nginx config, but we may put more aggressive
    intentional limits later if we end up using too much space.
  </p>
  <p>
    CPU/Memory are limited by our
    <a
      href="https://github.com/sphaerophoria/ball-machine/blob/master/src/ChamberTester.zig"
      >chamber tester</a
    >. Fuel is a pretty unitless measure, that I hope is consistent between
    machines. This comes from <a href="https://wasmtime.dev/">wasmtime</a> with
    little thought put in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Memory is limited pretty aggressively to the point where using default wasm
    compilation flags are likely to be insufficient. Specifically I have seen a
    default stack size of 1M set for modules, this needs to be brought down to
    fit in the 10 page limit currently set. See
    <a href="#examples">examples</a> for how to limit your memory usage
  </p>
  <p>
    Limit testing can be done either by upload modules to our server for us to
    validate, or you can clone
    <a href="https://github.com/sphaerophoria/ball-machine/">ball-machine</a> to
    use its chamber tester binary
  </p>
